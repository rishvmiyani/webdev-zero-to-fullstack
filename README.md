## ✨ What is this repo?

This repository is a structured log of my learning from a complete Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy.  
It is designed to be useful for:

- 🎓 **Beginners / intermediates** who want a clean, step‑by‑step roadmap.
- 💼 **Recruiters** who want to quickly see my skills, progress, and real projects.

## 📚 Tech stack covered

> Core technologies I learn and use in this journey.

- 🧱 HTML5 – semantic structure, forms, accessibility.
- 🎨 CSS3 – Flexbox, Grid, responsive design.
- 💫 Tailwind / Bootstrap (depending on course) – rapid UI styling.
- ⚙️ JavaScript (ES6+) – fundamentals to advanced concepts.
- 🌐 DOM, browser APIs, and asynchronous JS (fetch, promises, async/await).
- 🧩 Node.js & npm – backend runtime and tooling.
- 🛣️ Express.js – building REST APIs.
- 🍃 MongoDB / Mongoose – NoSQL database and data modeling.
- ⚛️ React (if included in course) – SPA development and component‑based UI.
- 🧪 Git & GitHub – version control, issues, and collaboration.

## 🗺️ Roadmap: Zero → Full‑Stack

This is the learning path followed in this repo. You can treat it as a roadmap and learn along with me. [web:41][web:43]

1. **Foundation**
   - Setup: VS Code, Git, GitHub, Node.js.
   - Command line basics and Git workflow.
2. **Frontend Basics**
   - HTML5 essentials and mini pages.
   - CSS fundamentals, layouts, and responsive design.
3. **Modern Styling**
   - Flexbox & Grid practice projects.
   - Tailwind / Bootstrap components and utilities.
4. **JavaScript Essentials**
   - Variables, functions, arrays, objects.
   - Control flow, ES6+ features, and problem‑solving.
5. **JavaScript in the Browser**
   - DOM manipulation, events, forms.
   - Small interactive projects (todo app, counters, etc.).
6. **Asynchronous JavaScript**
   - Promises, async/await, calling public APIs.
   - Mini apps using APIs (weather app, quotes app, etc.).
7. **Backend with Node & Express**
   - Building REST APIs and routing.
   - Middleware, error handling, authentication basics.
8. **Databases with MongoDB**
   - Data modeling, CRUD operations.
   - Connecting Node/Express with MongoDB (Mongoose).
9. **Frontend Framework (React)**
   - Components, props, state, hooks.
   - SPA structure, routing, and API integration.
10. **Full‑Stack Projects**
    - End‑to‑end apps (auth, CRUD, dashboards).
    - Deployment (Render/Netlify/Vercel, etc.).
11. **Extras & Best Practices**
    - Folder structure, environment variables.
    - Clean code, reusable components, and testing basics.

Inside each module:

- `README.md` → short explanation + checklist of topics.
- `notes/` → markdown notes, summaries, cheat‑sheets.
- `code/` → exercises and mini‑projects.
- `projects/` (for some modules) → bigger apps with their own README.

## 📝 Daily learning log

All my day‑by‑day progress will be tracked in [`daily-log.md`](./daily-log.md).  
Each entry will include:

- 📅 Date  
- 📌 Topics completed  
- 🧠 Key concepts learned  
- 🔗 Links to code / mini projects

Example entry:

2025-01-05
Finished HTML forms and semantic tags.

Built a simple registration page.

## 🚀 How to use this repo as a learner

You can clone this repository and follow the journey in the same order:

1. **Start at the Roadmap** and go folder by folder.  
2. Read the **module README** first to understand goals and prerequisites.  
3. Go through the **notes** and then try the **code/projects** yourself.  
4. Compare your solution with mine and improve it.  
5. Track your own progress in a new file like `my-progress.md`.

If you get stuck on any topic, feel free to open an issue with your question. 💬

## 💼 For recruiters

This repository demonstrates:

- Consistent **daily learning** and discipline through the `daily-log.md`.  
- Coverage of the **end‑to‑end web stack** (frontend, backend, database, deployment).  
- Growth from simple HTML pages to **full‑stack applications** with clean Git history.  

Quick links:

- ⭐ Best frontend project: `[PROJECT_NAME]` (link here)
- ⭐ Best backend/API project: `[PROJECT_NAME]` (link here)
- ⭐ Best full‑stack app: `[PROJECT_NAME]` (link here)

You can also check my pinned repositories for production‑level projects like fraud detection, railway systems, and more.

## 🧑‍💻 Setup & running code

Most mini‑projects follow a similar pattern:

clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/rishvmiyani/webdev-zero-to-fullstack.git
cd webdev-zero-to-fullstack

go into a project folder
cd 04-js-fundamentals/code/random-number-game

install dependencies (if package.json exists)
npm install

run the project
npm start # or node index.js / npm run dev depending on the project

text

For each bigger project there will be a dedicated README explaining:

- Required Node.js version.  
- Environment variables (if any).  
- Start scripts for development / production.
