# 🌐 03. Basics of Web Development

**Module 3**: Understanding how the web works at a fundamental level – from HTTP requests to full-stack architecture.

## 🎯 What you'll learn

- How data travels across the internet (DNS → HTTP → Servers)
- The complete flow of a web application (client → server → database)
- Frontend, Backend, APIs – roles and communication patterns

- [x] Map out complete web app architecture
- [x] Differentiate Frontend vs Backend vs APIs
- [x] Inspect real HTTP requests in Chrome DevTools
- [x] Created simple demo showing client-server flow

## 💡 Key takeaways

> "Everything is just HTTP requests and JSON responses."

🌐 Browser → DNS → Server → Database → Response → Render
Frontend = What user sees | Backend = What user doesn't see
API = Contract between Frontend & Backend (JSON over HTTP)
